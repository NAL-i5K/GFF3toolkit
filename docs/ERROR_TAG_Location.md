Detections of different error types are implemented at different directories under ./lib/.

* Intra-model errors (Ema) - multiple features within a model (lib/intra_model)
* Inter-model errors (Emr) - multiple features across models (lib/inter_model)
* Single feature errors (Esf) - single features (lib/single_feature)
